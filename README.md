## Santas list - group project

A school project where we got provided with a list of 100 people with different characteristics.
We use these characteristics to assign each person a "score" and determine whether they belong on the Nice or Naughty list.

People on the Nice list will be assigned an elf who will give them a gift based on the elfs speciality.

People on the Bad list will receive coal and have a 10% chance of being eaten by Gryla.
